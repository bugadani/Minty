========

The following comparison operators are available:

 * `<` or `is less than`
 * `<=` or `is less than or equals`
 * `>` or `is greater than`
 * `>=` or `is greater than or equals`
 * `=` or `equals`

     Note: two variables are identical when their type **and** value matches or they reference the same object instance

 * `!=`, `<>` or `does not equal`
