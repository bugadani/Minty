Logic operators
========

 * `and` or `&&`: `a && b` results in `true` if and only if both `a` and `b` are true.
 * `or` or `||`: `a || b` results in `true` if either `a` and `b` are true.
 * `!`: negates the logic value of the expression that follows
 * `xor`: `a xor b` results in `true` if `a` or `b` is true but not both.
